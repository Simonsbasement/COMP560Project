Description:
main.py is the entry point, also works as the host of the game. 
Main will initiate the game and ask for which agents are participating, and call the agents for their next moves. 
agents.py are all the agents. For now there are only random and user.
helper.py are all the helper functions, like get_avalible_column, print_board, make_move, and get_winner.
heuristics.py are all the heuristics. 

TODO (in descending order of priority):
Implement minimax /w alphabeta
An assortment of heuristics
Monte Carlo tree search

End result:
Consider each particular conbination of algorithm, heuristic, and maximum search depth as a participant.
There will be a tournament across all the participants, and their winrate recorded.
There will also be a spreadsheet comparing combinations of:
heuristics, win percentage, depth-limit, run time
