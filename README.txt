Description:
main.py is the entry point, also works as the host of the game. 
Main will initiate the game and ask for which agents are participating, and call the agents for their next moves. 
agents.py are all the agents. Most agents, except mcts, also need a heuristic to run.
helper.py are all the helper functions, like get_avalible_column, print_board, make_move, and get_winner.
heuristics.py are all the heuristics.
